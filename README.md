About Me - A Single-Page Portfolio

This project is a clean, modern, and fully responsive single-page "About Me" portfolio. Originally a multi-file project from the TripleTen Software Engineering bootcamp, it has been completely refactored and optimized to follow modern web development best practices, resulting in a polished and high-performing final product.

About The Project

This project serves as a personal introduction, showcasing my background as a recent software engineering graduate. The goal was to transform a standard student project into a professional portfolio piece by focusing on code quality, performance, and user experience.

The entire website is built within a single index.html file, demonstrating an understanding of self-contained components and streamlined architecture for smaller projects.

Key Features

- Single-File Architecture: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are consolidated into one file for simplicity and portability.

- Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures the layout looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.

- Modern Styling with Tailwind CSS: The UI is built with the popular utility-first CSS framework for a clean and consistent design.

- Interactive Contact Modal: A JavaScript-powered modal provides contact information without needing to navigate to a new page. It is fully accessible and can be closed via a button, the 'Escape' key, or by clicking the background overlay.

- Clean Code & Best Practices:

  - JavaScript is organized, commented, and runs only after the DOM is fully loaded.

  - HTML is semantic and structured logically.

  - CSS is minimal and organized within the <style> tag.

- Performance Optimizations:

  - Lazy Loading: Hobby images use loading="lazy" to defer loading until they are about to be scrolled into view, improving initial page speed.

  - Image Dimensions: width and height attributes are specified on images to prevent content layout shift (CLS) during page load.

- Accessibility & SEO:

Buttons and interactive elements include ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility.

A smooth-scrolling interface enhances user experience.

Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags are included for rich social media sharing previews.
