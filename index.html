          <h2 class="card__title">Travel</h2>
          <p class="card__text">From a young age, the world has been my 
            playground. I've traversed continents, immersing myself in 
            the vibrant tapestry of diverse cultures. From savoring 
            authentic street food in Mexico to marveling at ancient 
            ruins in Italy and witnessing the passion of tango in 
            Argentina, each journey has been a transformative experience. 
            Whether it's through sampling local cuisine, engaging in 
            traditional celebrations, or simply observing daily life, 
            I've gained a profound appreciation for the richness and 
            variety of human experience. My wanderlust is insatiable, 
            and I'm eager to continue exploring the world, collecting 
            stories and memories along the way.</p>

          <h2 class="card__title">Sports</h2>
          <p class="card__text">Sports have been a cornerstone 
            of my life since I was a young child. My journey 
            began with basketball, dribbling and shooting hoops 
            in a YMCA league at the tender age of four. I also 
            embraced other sports, spending summers honing my 
            skills at swim & dive camps and creating lasting 
            memories on the little league baseball field. 
            Though soccer ultimately captured my heart, 
            leading me to become a devoted Chelsea fan, the 
            lessons learned from various sports have shaped me 
            profoundly. Beyond the thrill of competition, sports 
            instilled in me the values of teamwork, discipline, 
            and resilience, fostering camaraderie and a lifelong 
            passion for athletic pursuits.</p>

        <div class="card__content">
          <h2 class="card__title">Video Games</h2>
          <p class="card__text">Video games have been a lifelong companion, 
            sparking joy and camaraderie since my early days with Crash 
            Bandicoot on the PlayStation 1. From countless Mario Party 
            battles to intense Call of Duty: Zombies sessions and epic 
            Super Smash Bros showdowns, gaming has always been a social 
            glue, bonding me with friends and creating unforgettable 
            memories.My passion for gaming even led me to competitive 
            success, reaching the top 1% in both League of Legends and 
            Overwatch, and proudly representing my university's team in a 
            national tournament. Though I've shifted away from the 
            competitive scene, gaming remains an integral part of my life, 
            offering a fun and relaxing escape.</p>

        <div class="card__content">
          <h2 class="card__title">Music</h2>
          <p class="card__text">Music has been a constant companion, 
            weaving a soundtrack to my life's journey. From my first 
            iPod nano to the cherished "Meteora" album gifted by my 
            grandma, each song has held a special meaning. Inspired 
            by my brother's love for bands like Sum 41, Nirvana, and 
            Blink-182, I delved into the world of rock music, attending 
            unforgettable concerts and immersing myself in the energy 
            and emotion of live performances. While rock remains a 
            cornerstone of my musical taste, my love for music extends 
            beyond genre boundaries. I find myself equally captivated 
            by the pulsating beats of EDM artists like Martin Garrix, 
            DJ Snake, and David Guetta, and the raw lyricism of 
            Hip-Hop/Rap icons like Travis Scott, Drake, and Gunna.</p>
